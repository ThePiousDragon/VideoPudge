A front-end for `ffmpeg` designed to practice some concepts in Swift. 

Things to do: 

- [ ] Create a Preference pane with an option to provide the path to the existing `ffmpeg` binary (at the moment, it's hard-coded as `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`
- [ ] Add an option to output the ffmpeg command without running it
- [ ] Add an input field for custom filters
- [ ] Rearrange the UI (probably in HStacks for input, codecs, output)
